## Hi there! 

λ I'm a young developer from Turkey, Eskişehir. I'm an high school student and I'm learning full-stack web development.

λ The passion for development started when Covid-19 started and we stayed at home. 

λ I've learnt React, Express and for fun I've learnt Discord.JS Frame work. 


λ Now, I'm working on Türkiyenin Gastronomi Haritası (will be shared and will be open-source when I finish it) and a Discord Bot for fun, economy, Moderation etc. (will be public when it finished)

Stay in touched!
